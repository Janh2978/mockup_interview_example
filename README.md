# Mockup interview example
Joshua Fluke talks in this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgwArRnh8n4) 
about a code test for an interview that involves a mockup. I tried to do the 
code for the mockup in less than an hour (time requested by the interviewer).

### Tools
I used **webpack**,<br>
- Autoprefixer(Postcss)<br>
- BrowserSync<br>
- Mini Css Extract plugin<br>
- Html plugin<br>
- Clean plugin<br>

**Bootstrap** (mainly for dropdown menu feature) and <br>
**Sass**

Honestly, this could have been easier to do without Bootstrap. Css Grid and Css Flex suits better for this.
